                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    This Privacy Policy outlines how Thebes Ads collects, uses, and protects your data when you use our
                    advertising and publisher technology services. Our services may include third-party content or
                    links, but this policy does not cover their practices. </p>

                <h2>Information Collection, Use, and Sharing</h2>
                <p>

                    Summary: We collect non-personally identifiable data (e.g., IP addresses, browser info) to improve
                    ad targeting and analyze trends. No Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is collected unless
                    voluntarily provided.
                    We use log files to track transactions, including IP addresses, browser types, internet service
                    providers, referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamps, and click counts. This data helps
                    analyze trends, administer services, track aggregate user movement, and target advertisements. We
                    may use automated profiling for ad targeting, which you can object to by contacting us
                    at support@thebesads.com.
                    Under GDPR, we process data like browser/device info, IP addresses, geo-location, and unique user
                    IDs for ad bidding and personalization. Shared data is aggregated to provide non-specific trends to
                    clients.
                </p>

                <h2>Collection, Use, and Retention of PII</h2>
                <p>
                    Summary: We only collect PII (e.g., name, email) when you provide it voluntarily, used for
                    marketing, support, or inquiries. PII is retained for up to 24 months or as required by law.
                    PII is used for marketing, recruiting, responding to inquiries, customer support, and service
                    delivery. It is retained only as needed or legally mandated, typically no longer than 24 months. You
                    can request access, updates, or deletion of your PII by contacting support@thebesads.com. </p>

                <h2>Collection, Use, and Retention of Non-PII</h2>
                <p>
                    Summary: Non-PII (e.g., cookies, device IDs) is collected to manage sessions and improve services,
                    retained for up to 12 months. You can manage cookies via browser settings or our consent tool.
                    Non-PII is collected via cookies, web beacons, and tags to analyze usage, detect malicious behavior,
                    and improve content. It is retained for up to 12 months or as needed. Opt out of non-essential
                    cookies through our cookie consent tool or browser settings. </p>

                <h2>Information Sharing</h2>
                <p>
                    Summary: We share PII or non-PII with trusted affiliates or vendors for marketing and operations,
                    using safeguards like Standard Contractual Clauses. Data may be disclosed for legal or safety
                    reasons.
                    We do not rent, share, or sell PII except with affiliates, subsidiaries, or trusted vendors meeting
                    privacy standards. Data may be disclosed when legally required or to address fraud or safety
                    threats. Transfers to regions without protections use safeguards like Standard Contractual Clauses.
                </p>

                <h2>Data Security</h2>
                <p>
                    Summary: We use encryption and access controls to protect your data from unauthorized access, loss,
                    or misuse. <br>
                    We implement technical and organizational measures, such as encryption and access controls, to
                    safeguard your data. <br>
                    Third-Party Services <br>
                    Summary: Third-party services (e.g., ad networks) may collect non-PII for interest-based
                    advertising. Opt out via industry-standard tools. <br>
                    Third-party services, like ad networks or social media widgets, may collect visit data (e.g., pages
                    visited, browser details). <br>Opt out through: <br>
